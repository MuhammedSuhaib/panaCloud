# PanaCloud Website Clone

This project represents "Step 0 of Q2" and serves as a demonstration of proficiency in building pixel-perfect website clones using fundamental web technologies: HTML and CSS.

It showcases the ability to develop high-fidelity web interfaces without reliance on advanced frameworks like Next.js, emphasizing a strong foundation in core web development principles.

The project is a static website template for a company or agency named "PanaCloud," featuring various sections such as services, portfolio, about us, and contact information, all implemented with basic HTML and custom CSS for styling and responsiveness.
